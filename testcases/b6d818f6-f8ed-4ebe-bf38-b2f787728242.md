# Test Case for rdgf failure

This test case is designed to verify the fix for the rdgf issue reported in the production environment. The goal is to ensure that the rdgf executes successfully without any failures.

## Preconditions

The tester needs to have access to the production environment and the rdgf test case. The system should be in a clean state before the execution of the test case.

## Test Steps

### Step 1

**Action:** Navigate to the rdgf test case in the production environment.

**Expected Result:** The rdgf test case should be accessible and ready for execution.

### Step 2

**Action:** Execute the rdgf test case.

**Expected Result:** The rdgf test case should run without any errors.

### Step 3

**Action:** Check the final result of the rdgf test case once the execution is finished.

**Expected Result:** The final result should show that the rdgf test case has passed successfully.

## Expected Final Result

The rdgf test case should execute successfully without any failures in the production environment.
