# Test Case: Translate App to Norwegian

This test case verifies that the application has been accurately translated to Norwegian and that the language selection or automatic locale detection is functioning as expected.

## Preconditions

Tester must have access to a version of the application that includes the Norwegian translation. The tester should also have basic understanding of Norwegian language to validate translation.

## Test Steps

### Step 1

**Action:** Open the application.

**Expected Result:** The application launches successfully.

### Step 2

**Action:** Navigate to the language selection settings in the application.

**Expected Result:** Language selection settings are accessible and visible.

### Step 3

**Action:** Check the available language options.

**Expected Result:** Norwegian should be one of the available language options.

### Step 4

**Action:** Select 'Norwegian' as the language.

**Expected Result:** The application language changes to Norwegian.

### Step 5

**Action:** Navigate through different sections of the application.

**Expected Result:** All user-facing strings in the application are in Norwegian.

### Step 6

**Action:** Set the device locale to Norway and relaunch the application.

**Expected Result:** The application automatically detects the locale and displays content in Norwegian.

### Step 7

**Action:** Change the device locale to a non-Norwegian locale and relaunch the application.
