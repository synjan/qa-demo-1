# Test Case for rdgf Failure Issue

This test case is designed to verify the fix for the rdgf test failure issue reported on GitHub. The test case will include clear preconditions, setup steps, step-by-step testing procedures, expected results for each step, and overall expected outcome. Edge cases and negative testing scenarios will also be included where appropriate.

## Preconditions

Tester should have access to the production environment. The application under test should be in the state when the rdgf test case can be executed.

## Test Steps

### Step 1

**Action:** Launch the application in the production environment.

**Expected Result:** The application should be successfully launched without any errors.

### Step 2

**Action:** Navigate to the feature/functionality where rdgf test case needs to be executed.

**Expected Result:** The user should be able to navigate to the respective feature/functionality without any issues.

### Step 3

**Action:** Execute the rdgf test case.

**Expected Result:** The rdgf test case should execute without any errors.

### Step 4

**Action:** Check the results of the rdgf test case.

**Expected Result:** The results of the rdgf test case should match the expected results.

### Step 5

**Action:** Repeat steps 2 to 4 for edge cases and negative testing scenarios.

**Expected Result:** The application should handle edge cases and negative scenarios correctly without any errors.

## Expected Final Result

The rdgf test case should pass without any errors in all scenarios including edge cases and negative scenarios.
